## Initialization Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SDK Not Initialized">
    **Error**: `Stringboot SDK is not initialized`

    **Solution**: Ensure you are wrapping your app with `StringbootProvider` (React) or calling `Stringboot.init()` (Vanilla) before accessing any strings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CORS Errors">
    **Error**: `Access to fetch at ... has been blocked by CORS policy`

    **Solution**: This usually happens if you are using a development token in a production environment or vice versa. Check your allowed domains in the Stringboot Dashboard settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## String Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Strings showing as ??key??">
    **Cause**: The string key was not found in the local cache.

    **Solutions**:
    1.  Ensure the key exists in the dashboard.
    2.  Check if the SDK has finished initializing (`loading` state).
    3.  Clear your browser's IndexedDB and reload to force a fresh sync.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next.js Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hydration Mismatch">
    **Error**: `Text content does not match server-rendered HTML`

    **Solution**: Ensure you are using the `StringbootProvider` correctly in your `layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx`. For Server Components, ensure you are awaiting the string fetch properly. See the [Next.js Guide](/web-sdk/nextjs) for details.
