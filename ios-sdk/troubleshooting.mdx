## Strings Not Loading

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check API Token">
    Ensure your API token is correct and corresponds to the right environment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check Network">
    If the device is offline and the cache is empty, strings will return the fallback format `??key??`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enable Logging">
    Enable debug logging to see what's happening under the hood.

    ```swift
    #if DEBUG
    StringbootLogger.isLoggingEnabled = true
    StringbootLogger.logLevel = .debug
    #endif
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cache Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cache Not Persisting">
    Ensure you are initializing the SDK *before* accessing any strings. In SwiftUI, use the `init()` method of your `App` struct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memory Pressure">
    If the system is under heavy memory pressure, the SDK might evict strings from the memory cache. They will be re-fetched from the disk cache or network when needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Certificate Pinning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Requests Failing in Debug">
    The SDK enables SSL certificate pinning by default in **Release** builds. If you are using a proxy (like Charles or Proxyman) to debug network traffic, requests will fail.

    **Solution**: Test network calls in a **Debug** build, where pinning is disabled.
  </Accordion>
