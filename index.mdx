## What is Stringboot?

Stringboot is a powerful internationalization (i18n) SDK that provides high-performance string localization for modern applications. It features smart multi-layered caching, offline support, and reactive string updates with minimal overhead.

## Why Stringboot?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Offline-First Architecture" icon="wifi-slash">
    Stringboot is designed to work seamlessly offline. After the initial sync, all strings are cached locally, ensuring your app works perfectly without network connectivity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Blazing Fast Performance" icon="bolt">
    Multi-layer caching ensures sub-millisecond string lookups from memory, with automatic fallback to local database and network when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bandwidth Efficient" icon="chart-line">
    Delta sync using String-Sync v2 protocol means only changed strings are downloaded. ETag-based caching prevents unnecessary network requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developer Friendly" icon="code">
    Native SDKs for each platform with idiomatic APIs. React hooks for web, Flow API for Android, SwiftUI integration for iOS.
